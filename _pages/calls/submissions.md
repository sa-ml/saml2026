## Call for Papers

The increasing usage of machine learning (ML) coupled with the software architectural challenges of the modern era has given rise to two broad research challenges: i) Software architecture (SA) for ML-based systems and ii) ML techniques for (better) architecting any software system. In recent times, both the research and practitioner community have started exploring these research areas at the intersection of SA and ML. As a result, there have been emerging contributions from the scientific and practitioner community in these two research areas. However, these contributions are scattered across different communities of software engineering, self-adaptation, ML, etc. The goal of SAML 2026 is to bring together practitioners and the research community in one common platform to explore: i) how to come up with better SA practices for architecting ML-based systems; ii) how to leverage ML techniques to better architect software systems; iii) state of research and practice in architecting ML-based systems and in using ML techniques for architecting modern software systems. Further, SAML 2026 shall also provide a common forum to bring together both practitioners and researchers of SA and ML communities to identify and fill the research gaps that can benefit both communities. SAML 2026 seeks contributions in the form of full research papers, industry experience reports and short papers in topics including but not limited to:

SAML 2026 seeks contributions in the form of full research papers, industry experience reports and short papers in topics including but not limited to:

+ Architecture design & evaluation of ML-enabled systems.
+ Architecture frameworks, patterns, and models for ML-enabled systems.
+ Quality attributes of ML-enabled systems.
+ Architecture and technical debt in ML-enabled systems.
+ Architecting data or ML pipelines.
+ Software architecture for LLM and agentic LLM systems.
+ Software architecture and MLOps practices.
+ Social and organizational aspects of architecting ML-enabled systems.
+ Role of the software architect for ML-enabled systems.
+ Architecting self-adaptive systems using ML.
+ ML for synthesizing architecture documentation.
+ ML for detecting architecture and design (anti-)patterns.
+ ML for guiding or conducting architectural refactorings.
+ ML for architecture evaluation.
+ ML for architectural knowledge extraction.
+ LLMs for software architecture design and analysis.


## Types of Contributions

+ **Registered reports (RRs)** i.e., detailed study designs that are submitted for feedback before study execution.
Accepted RRs have a clear path to publishing a full paper in ACM TOSEM, our journal collaboration partner. RRs must not exceed 6 pages + 2 pages for references.

+ **Short papers**  e.g., industry experience reports or position, vision, or reflection papers, which must not exceed 5 pages + 1 page for references.

All contributions should be submitted before the submission deadline using ICSA's EasyChair [online submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=icsa2026) (select the track "5th International Workshop on Software Architecture and Machine Learning"). Submissions must follow the [IEEE Computer Science proceedings format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) and abide by the **single-anonymous** submission process (author identities are known). All submissions must be original work and must not have been previously published, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere. Artifacts related to the paper, if any, can be submitted by uploading the data/code to repositories such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), with the link to these contributions included in the paper.

## Proceedings

The accepted regular and short papers will be published in _ICSA 2026 Companion proceedings_, and appear in _IEEE Xplore Digital Library_. The position papers will be published in the SAML 2026 web page. At least one author of each accepted paper should register for the conference and participate in the workshop.
